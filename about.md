The goal of this website is to put together, in a comprehensible fashion, contents related to the theory of information dynamics and complex systems. In a nutshell, complex systems are systems composed by a number of interdependent parts in way such that "the whole is more than the sum of the parts"; and information dynamics refers to the idea of studying these systems using principles of information theory -- broadly understood, including the foundational work of Claude Shannon, Ronald Fisher, Norbert Wiener, and their followers and minions.

These fascinating topics find application in a wide range of scientific disciplines, and hence diverse contributions to their development are scattered in various literatures including information theory, statistical physics, computational neuroscience, machine learning, and many others. Moreover, information dynamics is a young field of research which is still under active development, and therefore it experiences significant advances every year. 

The interdisciplinary and highly dynamic nature of these topics make them difficult to grasp. In effect, relevant contributions appear every year, and are scattered under disimilar labels. It is our hope that this webpage may help by puting a (at least partially) consistent view on these topics.

We are a group of enthusiastic scientists of diverse backgrounds, united by the interest on the informational perspective on complex systems. These subjects are bast, deep, and mostly unexplored; hence we welcome everyone to join us in this exploration.
