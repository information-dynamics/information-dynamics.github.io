The goal of this website is to put together, in a comprehensible fashion, contents related to the theory of information dynamics and complex systems. Complex systems are those composed by a number of interdependent parts in way such that "the whole is more than the sum of the parts"; and the goal of information dynamics is to study these systems using principles of information theory -- broadly understood, including the foundational work of Claude Shannon, Ronald Fisher, Norbert Wiener, and their followers and minions.

We are a group of enthusiastic scientists of diverse backgrounds, united by the interest on the informational perspective on complex systems. These subjects are vast and mostly unexplored; and this website is actively **under construction**. We welcome everyone to join us in this exploration. Please get in touch!
