These fascinating topics find application in a wide range of scientific disciplines, and hence diverse contributions to their development are scattered in various literatures including information theory, statistical physics, computational neuroscience, machine learning, and many others. Moreover, information dynamics is a young field of research which is still under active development, and therefore it experiences significant advances every year.

The interdisciplinary and highly dynamic nature of these topics make them difficult to grasp. In effect, relevant contributions appear every year, and are scattered under disimilar labels. It is our hope that this webpage may help by puting a (at least partially) consistent view on these topics.
