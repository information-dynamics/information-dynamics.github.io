### JIDT

The `JIDT` toolbox is a swiss-army knife of information dynamics analysis of complex systems, with special focus on non-parametric estimators for continuous data. The toolbox can be used from a broad array of modern languages (e.g. Python, Octave/Matlab, R) without the need to install or compile, implements a large variety of measures, and includes GPU support.

### dit

The Python package `dit` (for Discrete Information Theory) is light and powerful tool to study information-theoretic quantities in discrete-valued systems. The package, which is easily `pip`-installable, features a long list of available measures, including a frequently updated suite of partial information decomposition tools.

### IDTxl

`IDTxl` is a Python package specialised in network inference through multivariate transfer entropy. It has built-in data loaders for most common neuroscientific data formats, and supports parallelisation. It serves a purpose similar to `tigramite` (see below), although it places more emphasis on non-parametric estimators of multivariate transfer entropy.

### tigramite

Like `IDTxl`, `tigramite` is a Python package devoted to statistical causal discovery for complex systems, extending beyond transfer entropy and with multiple options for modelling and significance testing.

### TRENTOOL

Matlab package `TRENTOOL` was one of the first toolboxes for large-scale transfer entropy analysis applied to the neurosciences. It includes a comprehensive set of configurable parameters and advanced statistical significance testing functionality.
